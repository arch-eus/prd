# PWA Implementation

The Task Manager application has been enhanced with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, enabling offline use, installation to home screens, and a more app-like experience.

## Features

1. **Offline Functionality**: The application works even when offline, using Workbox for service worker management
2. **Installable**: Users can install the app to their home screen on mobile and desktop
3. **App-like Experience**: Full-screen mode, custom theming, and smoother navigation
4. **Auto Updates**: Automatic update detection with user prompt to refresh
5. **Performance Optimization**: Caching of assets for faster loading

## Components

- **PWAHandler.svelte**: Manages service worker registration and update notifications
- **PWAInstallBanner.svelte**: Provides an install prompt for users who haven't installed the app

## Implementation Details

### Service Worker

The service worker is implemented using Vite PWA Plugin, which:
- Precaches essential application assets
- Provides runtime caching strategies
- Handles service worker lifecycle events
- Manages update prompts

### Manifest

The web app manifest (`manifest.webmanifest`) defines:
- App name and description
- Icons for different platforms and sizes
- Theme and background colors
- Display characteristics
- Screenshots for app stores

### Installation Logic

The app detects when it can be installed and shows a custom install banner. This is implemented in `PWAInstallBanner.svelte`, which:
1. Captures the `beforeinstallprompt` event
2. Shows a customized banner to the user
3. Triggers the native install prompt when requested
4. Tracks installation success

## Testing PWA Features

To test the PWA features:

1. **Installation**: 
   - On Chrome, look for the install icon in the address bar
   - On mobile, use "Add to Home Screen" from the browser menu

2. **Offline Testing**:
   - Open the app normally
   - Turn off your internet connection (airplane mode)
   - Refresh the page - it should still load
   - Try creating and managing tasks offline

3. **Updates Testing**:
   - Make a change to the app and reload
   - You should see an update notification

## Integration with Evolu

The PWA implementation works seamlessly with Evolu, providing:
- Offline data management via Evolu's local-first approach
- Sync capabilities when back online
- Data persistence even when the app is reinstalled

## Future Enhancements

1. **Background Sync**: Queue changes made offline to sync when back online
2. **Push Notifications**: Notify users about important tasks and updates
3. **Share Target**: Allow sharing content directly to the app
4. **Content Preloading**: Intelligently preload data for better offline experience
