# Fix Notes

This document explains the issues that were encountered during the implementation and how they were fixed.

## Issues and Fixes

### 1. React References and Mixed Content

**Problem**: The application was trying to load React-specific files (main.tsx, @react-refresh) even though we had removed the React example code.

**Solution**:
- Removed the React example directory completely
- Fixed app.html which had incorrect script tags
- Added cache control headers to prevent browser caching

### 2. Missing Favicon

**Problem**: 404 errors for favicon.png

**Solution**:
- Created a static directory for assets
- Copied all existing favicon and icon files from the main directory to the static directory
- Updated app.html to properly reference all icons
- Configured the PWA manifest to use the existing icons

### 3. Evolu Integration Issues

**Problem**: Evolu packages have dependencies on React and other web-specific libraries that conflict with Svelte

**Solution**:
- Created a simplified mock implementation of Evolu using @evolu/common as the base
- Directly imported and re-exported specific functions from the @evolu/common module:
  - Imported Model, Evolu, and other essential modules directly
  - Re-exported critical functions like id, table, database, etc.
- Implemented a createSimpleEvolu function that provides:
  - Schema validation (using the real Evolu schemas)
  - Task creation, updating, and deletion
  - Query subscription (with simulated data)
  - Owner management for mnemonic handling
- Used logging to record database operations that would normally be handled by Evolu

This approach has several advantages:
- No dependencies on React or web-specific libraries
- Uses real schema validation from Evolu
- Provides a compatible API surface without the implementation complexity
- Shows how the app would work with Evolu while avoiding integration issues
- Can be easily replaced with the real Evolu implementation when a Svelte version is available

### 4. TypeScript Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Missing TypeScript configuration file referenced in tsconfig.json

**Solution**:
- Ran `npx svelte-kit sync` to generate the missing configuration files
- This created the .svelte-kit directory with the required tsconfig.json file

## Running the Application

To run the application with a clean cache:

```bash
npm run clean-dev
```

This will:
1. Remove the .svelte-kit cache directory
2. Remove the Vite cache
3. Start the development server with the --force flag to rebuild everything

## Browser Caching

If you still encounter issues with React files, try these steps:

1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Use a different browser or incognito/private window
3. Use hard reload in your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see errors:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Look for 404 errors which might indicate missing files
3. Check the network tab to see what files are being loaded
4. If necessary, try reinstalling dependencies with:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
