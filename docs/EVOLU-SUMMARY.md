# Evolu Integration Summary

The Todo application has been successfully integrated with Evolu.dev to provide enhanced offline capabilities and data synchronization.

## Changes Made

1. **Evolu Database Schema**
   - Created task schema using Evolu's type-safe schema definition
   - Added indexes for optimized queries
   - Implemented type validation using Effect Schema

2. **Store Integration**
   - Created Evolu-backed stores that maintain the same API surface as before
   - Implemented data conversion between Evolu and application formats
   - Added query-based store subscriptions

3. **UI Components**
   - Added EvoluProvider for context management
   - Created EvoluSync component for backup and restore features
   - Updated the app layout to use the provider

4. **Migration Path**
   - Created utility to migrate existing data from idb-keyval to Evolu
   - Added initialization code to perform migration on startup

5. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed EVOLU.md documentation explaining the integration

## How It Works

1. **Data Storage**: Evolu uses SQLite to store task data locally with a defined schema
2. **Offline Support**: All operations work offline and persist in the local database
3. **Sync Capability**: Data can be synced between devices using encrypted mnemonic phrases
4. **API Compatibility**: The existing task store API is maintained for compatibility

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Run the application and create some tasks
2. View your mnemonic phrase using the Sync panel in the sidebar
3. Open the application in another browser or device
4. Use the "Restore Data" option with your mnemonic phrase
5. Verify that all your tasks appear on the new device

## Next Steps

1. Add real-time synchronization with WebSocket support
2. Improve error handling and network status indicators
3. Add conflict resolution UI for concurrent edits
