# Task Manager Architecture Documentation

## 1. Introduction and Goals

### 1.1 Requirements Overview

The Task Manager is a modern task management application with the following key requirements:

- **Functional Requirements**
  - Create, edit, and manage tasks with detailed information (title, descriptions, due dates, etc.)
  - Support for organizing tasks with tags/labels
  - Support for recurring tasks (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
  - Calendar integration for date-based navigation
  - Track completed tasks and provide a task logbook
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Data export functionality

- **Non-Functional Requirements**
  - Offline-first capability
  - Real-time collaboration with multi-user editing
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) support for cross-platform accessibility
  - Responsive design for various devices
  - High performance on standard web browsers

### 1.2 Quality Goals

| 3 | Responsiveness | Interface must be fast and responsive regardless of task count |
| 4 | Usability | Interface should be intuitive with minimal learning curve |
| 5 | Extensibility | Architecture should allow for easy addition of features |

### 1.3 Stakeholders

| Stakeholders | Expectations |
|--------------|------------|
| Task Users | Reliable task management with offline access and collaboration |
| Developers | Clean architecture, maintainable code, easy extension |

## 2. Architecture Constraints

### 2.1 Technical Constraints

- **Browser Compatibility**: Must work on modern browsers with IndexedDB and Service Worker support
- **Web Stack**: Built using SvelteKit ecosystem
- **Offline Storage**: Must use browser-based storage (IndexedDB)
- **Collaboration**: Must support multi-user editing using CRDT technology

### 2.2 Organizational Constraints

- **Open Source**: Components and libraries should preferably be open source
- **Maintainability**: Code must be maintainable and well-documented
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality must work without requiring advanced features

## 3. System Scope and Context

### 3.1 Business Context

```plantuml
@startuml Business Context
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml

Person(user, "Task User", "A person who manages tasks")
Person(collaborator, "Collaborator", "A person who collaborates on tasks")

System(taskManager, "Task Manager", "Allows users to create, manage, and collaborate on tasks")
System_Ext(browser, "Web Browser", "Provides runtime environment")
System_Ext(websocketServer, "Collaboration Server", "Enables real-time collaboration through WebSockets")

Rel(user, taskManager, "Uses")
Rel(collaborator, taskManager, "Collaborates through")
Rel(taskManager, browser, "Runs in")
Rel(taskManager, websocketServer, "Syncs changes via")

Rel(taskManager, indexedDB, "Stores data in")
Rel(taskManager, serviceWorker, "Uses for offline capability")
Rel(taskManager, websocketServer, "Syncs changes via")

@enduml
```

## 4. Solution Strategy

The key architectural decisions:

1. **SvelteKit as UI Framework**: Provides excellent developer experience, small bundle size, and reactivity model.

2. **SyncedStore for Data Management**: Implements Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) for conflict resolution and multi-user editing.

3. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Enables installation on devices and offline capabilities.

4. **Modular Component Structure**: Following a component-based architecture for maintainability and reusability.

5. **WebSocket for Real-time Collaboration**: Y-WebSocket provides the communication layer for multi-user support.

actor "User A" as UserA
actor "User B" as UserB
participant "Device A" as DeviceA
participant "Device B" as DevB
participant "Collab Server" as Server
participant "CRDT Engine" as CRDT

UserA -> DeviceA: Edits task
DeviceA -> CRDT: Local update
CRDT -> DeviceA: Updates local state
DeviceA -> Server: Sends operation
Server -> DeviceB: Forwards operation
DeviceB -> CRDT: Merges operation
CRDT -> DeviceB: Resolves conflicts
DeviceB -> UserB: Shows merged result

## 8. Cross-cutting Concepts

### 8.1 User Interface

- **Component Architecture**: The UI is built using Svelte components, organized in a hierarchical structure.
- **Reactive Design**: Svelte's reactivity model ensures UI stays in sync with the application state.
- **Responsive Layout**: Tailwind CSS provides responsive design capabilities.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcut support for power users.

### 8.2 Persistence

- **CRDT for Data**: Conflict-free Replicated Data Types ensure consistency during concurrent edits.
- **IndexedDB for Storage**: Browser's IndexedDB provides robust offline storage.
- **Serialization**: Custom serialization/deserialization for Date objects and complex structures.

### 8.3 Error Handling

- **UI Error Boundaries**: Components handle and display errors appropriately.
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Store reset functionality for data corruption cases.
- **Offline-First**: Operations queue during offline mode and sync when connection is restored.

### 8.4 Security

- **Data Isolation**: Each user's data is isolated in their own browser storage.
- **Collaboration Security**: Room-based collaboration with optional security features.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing.
