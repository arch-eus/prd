# Lightweight Threat Model for PRDrevive Task Manager Application

## 1. Assets to Protect

- **User Task Data**: Personal or potentially sensitive task information stored in IndexedDB
- **Collaboration Data**: Real-time shared information between users
- **User Identity**: Display names and room associations
- **System Integrity**: Prevention of data corruption or loss

## 2. Threat Agents

- **Malicious Users**: Individuals who join collaboration rooms with bad intent
- **Web Attackers**: Those who try to exploit client-side vulnerabilities
- **Network Eavesdroppers**: Entities monitoring WebSocket traffic
- **Vercel or Infrastructure Providers**: Access to hosted components

## 3. Key Attack Vectors

### Client-Side Vulnerabilities

1. **IndexedDB Exposure**: 
   - Local storage could be accessed by malicious browser extensions or XSS
   - Severity: Medium
   - Likelihood: Low

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Task content (title, description, notes) isn't sanitized and could contain malicious scripts
   - Severity: High
   - Likelihood: Medium

### WebSocket Server Issues

3. **Unauthenticated Access**:
   - No authentication mechanism for WebSocket connections
   - Anyone can join any room by knowing its name
   - Severity: High
   - Likelihood: High

4. **Unencrypted Communications**:
   - Default WebSocket uses 'ws://' instead of secure 'wss://'
   - Allows traffic interception on public networks
   - Severity: High
   - Likelihood: Medium

5. **WebSocket Data Injection**:
   - No validation of messages received via WebSocket
   - Could allow injecting malicious content into the CRDT
   - Severity: Medium
   - Likelihood: Medium

### Deployment-Specific (Vercel)

6. **WebSocket Server Deployment**:
   - Vercel doesn't natively support long-lived WebSocket connections
   - Requires separate hosting for the collaboration server
   - Severity: Medium (architectural concern)
   - Likelihood: Certain

7. **CORS Configuration**:
   - If WebSocket server is hosted separately, requires careful CORS setup
   - Incorrect CORS could prevent or over-permit connections
   - Severity: Medium
   - Likelihood: Medium

8. **Client-Side API Exposure**:
   - All client-side code is exposed to users
   - Could reveal architectural details useful for attacks
   - Severity: Low
   - Likelihood: High

## 4. Mitigations

### Critical Mitigations

1. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Add user authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Require validated tokens to join collaboration rooms
   - Consider using Auth0 or Vercel KV for user management

2. **Enable Transport Security**:
   - Use 'wss://' for all WebSocket connections
   - Deploy WebSocket server with proper TLS certification
   - Consider using a service like Pusher or Socket.io Cloud with built-in security

3. **Add Input Validation**:
   - Sanitize all task content before storage and rendering
   - Implement validation for WebSocket messages to prevent injection

### Important Mitigations

4. **Deployment Architecture**:
   - Host the WebSocket server on a platform supporting WebSockets (e.g., Heroku, Digital Ocean)
   - Configure proper CORS headers to allow only Vercel-hosted application
   - Consider serverless WebSocket options compatible with Vercel

5. **Room Access Control**:
   - Implement room-based authentication
   - Use unique, hard-to-guess room identifiers
   - Create permissions system for admin/member roles

6. **Data Protection**:
   - Consider encrypting sensitive task data in IndexedDB
   - Add option for private rooms with E2E encryption
   - Implement secure content policy headers

### Additional Considerations

7. **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**:
   - Add rate limiting to WebSocket server
   - Implement room join/creation throttling
   - Monitor for abnormal traffic patterns

8. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Add server-side persistence for critical data
   - Implement data export functionality for users
   - Create recovery mechanisms for data corruption

## 5. Vercel-Specific Deployment Recommendations

1. **Application Architecture**:
   - Frontend (Vercel): Main Svelte application
   - Backend (Separate): WebSocket server on WebSocket-friendly hosting

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Store sensitive configuration in Vercel Environment Variables
   - Use different configurations for development/production
   - Implement feature flags to disable collaboration in sensitive contexts

3. **Security Headers**:
   - Configure Content-Security-Policy to restrict connections
   - Enable other security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc.)
   - Use Vercel Edge Functions for additional security checks

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement client-side error reporting
   - Add server-side logging for collaboration server
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity patterns

## 6. Risk Assessment Summary

- **Highest Risk**: Unauthenticated WebSocket access allowing unauthorized data access
- **Medium Risk**: Unencrypted WebSocket traffic exposing data in transit  
- **Architectural Risk**: Separation of WebSocket server from Vercel hosting

The application's current implementation prioritizes functionality over security, which is common in early development. For a production deployment, implementing the critical mitigations above would significantly improve the security posture.
